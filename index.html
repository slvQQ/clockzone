But getting into it can be quite expensive so I wanted to put together a little guide to help you put together a more budget-friendly PC and to help you avoid some of the mistakes that might cost you a little bit in the long term. Building a budget PC can be quite an art it’s all about cutting the right corners shaving off unnecessary costs while keeping performance sky high, any aesthetic items should be the first to cut back and spending less on parts that don’t directly affect your frames per second is a surefire way to save yourself some cash.</p></div>
