                <div class = "textarticles1"> <p>So what parts do you need for your build? Well, there are the essentials: RAM, a case, graphics, processor, cooler, thermal paste, operating system, motherboard, and finally, the power supply. Which manufacturer you use for each part is entirely up to you. However, there are some things you should keep in mind.First, determine what your computer will be for. If it’s a gaming desktop, pay close attention to your RAM, CPU, and GPU trio — they’ll need to be the highest-end parts in the system. If you’re a video editor, drop costs on the graphics and spend more on storage and RAM, for example. An easy way of doing this: use PCPartPicker to estimate the power needed on your behalf, or you can look up the power requirements of each individual part.</p></div></div>

                    <!--         Article 2 text          -->
                
                <div class = "textarticles2"> <p>As we anticipated when we reviewed AMD's new flagship 16-core Ryzen 9 3950X, rather than testing it on the very high-end Gigabyte X570 Aorus Xtreme, we want to see how it does on the low-end. We're not bothering with A320 boards -- that’s a bit too silly we figured -- but decent AMD B450 boards do make sense, maybe not right now, but in the future as a potential upgrade for many AM4 owners. Here's what we're thinking...The R9 3950X is a $750 processor, so pairing it with motherboards priced a little over $100 wouldn’t be considered by most right now. However, in the not too distant future you’ll be able to snag a second hand 3950X at a significant discount, that’s just the way it seems to go with AMD processors.</p></div>

                <div class = "textarticles3"> <p>For this mid-tier gaming PC, we're targeting a budget of $1,000. For that price, you can get a quality build that runs modern games well, if not always at the highest settings at high resolutions. We're going for a system that can reliably push 60 fps at 1080p with graphics settings pushed to their limit, and reach higher refresh rates in less-demanding games such as Overwatch or Rocket League.To keep the price down, our mid-tier gaming build has flipped from Nvidia to AMD, and has some solid headroom for upgrades with compatibility for AMD's 3rd generation Ryzen processors and a modular PSU with wattage to spare. A fun bonus we get from the processor we've chosen is the ability to overclock the system for some added performance.</p></div>
