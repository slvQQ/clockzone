Report: Large Coursework<br> <br>
Silviu Badica <br> <br>
My website talks about trending in computers and describes different computer builds and computer components in a detailed way. For example; the website consists of 5 pages and each are about news that appear lately and that are popular about the technology in computer systems, articles posted by tech enthusiasts, a list of computer builds that users can look at and a review page that rates different computers to the audience. The last page contains information about the page such as a mobile number, an e-mail and social media links that user can follow. The main target audience are power users, tech enthusiasts, IT decision makers and gamers that have an interest towards the technology of computer systems. <br> <br>
What inspired me from creating my website were websites such as OverClockers, CCL Computers, PC Specialist. My hobby is also an inspiration as I like computer systems and how they are built. <br> <br>
Before developing the website, I have chosen to structure it using Microsoft PowerPoint and I did my best in applying the wireframe I have created to the website. I have considered accessibility for my website by manually evaluating the menu so it can be accessed from different screen displays of different devices for example from a phone display, tablet display, laptop display etc. I have also considered clarity by making sure that images and text are not blurry so they are readable by users that might have visual issues. <br> <br>
Before developing the website I have watched tutorials on YouTube and I have learned how to use HTML tags effectively and also how to use CSS effectively for example; using the FlexBox to position elements around the page; I have taken examples from the YouTube videos and modified in order to achieve my aims when developing the website however, most examples from the YouTube videos were used as inspiration to make the website. <br> <br>
I have particularly worked well on making my buttons as I have worked on their functionality to make sure that they link to each page and also when positioning them on the page. I have also worked well on using the FlexBox when creating the articles as I have created three different boxes to lay each article and then manage to control these boxes at once and also control each individual one. I have also worked on well structuring text using CSS.  What I think might be improved is the positioning of the elements when minimising the window as this causes elements to overlap with each other; I could potentially fix this by using properties effectively and try to understand what each means however, this has led to confusion as there were too many properties explained in the tutorials  which has caused me to mix unnecessary properties with each other which has eventually led to elements overlapping each other when minimising the window. In addition, I think I couldâ€™ve been more creative by choosing different colours or maybe using an image as a background to make the website more appealing.
                
One thing to mention aboyt my pages is that at the start I have not considered adding the DOCTYPE html tag at the start of the code. After I have finished the website, I have checked my html files using the W3C Markup Validation Service and has checked that the DOCTYPE html tag was missing at the start of the code. When I have added that, it completely messed the elements up by wrongly positioing them around the page. I have looked online for solutions (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30694796/html-5-doctype-messes-up-layout/30694851) and found the only solution which was that I should add html, body {height: 100%} at the start of the CSS file. I have added this to my CSS file and still did not fix the problem even after restarting Brackets.
